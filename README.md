Problem Introduction:
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access,
if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
The main intention to use this problem was for Streamlit library in Python. We have deployed the ML solution used in Python using Streamlit, which predicts the outcome,
with the defined parameters.
Was planning to go initially for Flask, but came through streamlit, by one of the youtuber's recommendation- credit- Krish Naik.
